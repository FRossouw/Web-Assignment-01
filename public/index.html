                <p> As a young man, I always try to further myself, whether by educating myself or by going beyond what
                    is expected.
                    This is because you need to make life what you want it to be. As Elon Musk says: "When something is
                    important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor." That is something I took to
                    heart, due to some life hardships.

                <p>Whilst engaging in my studies I was part of various larger projects at Belgium Campus: Innovation
                    Solutions for Food Security in Africa, Health of Students within South Africa, Aviation and
                    Aeronautics (Belgium Campus). My current project is the gamification of a non-Academic Educational
                    concept (Confidential information).

                <h2>Student Representative Councils</h2>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>I was part of the Student Representative Council (SRC) from 2018, where I served as the head member
                    of a committee (Social Committee). The social committee was designated to form and manage various
                    activities and social events on campus for the students, with the aid of students.</br></br>

                    The head member of each committee was referred to as a Board Member within the SRC and they would
                    fall directly under the supervision of the SRC Vice Presidents and hence forth the SRC President.
                    During 2018 another committee was added to my list of responsibilities: Student Relations, whereby
                    you would deal with students /various activities daily and the solving of student related problems
                    where possible..</br></br>

                    With the commencement of the current year (2019), I was awarded the position of Co-Vice President of
                    the SRC which I regard as a huge honour. This position encouraged me to manage, support and to be a
                    role model towards other students.</br></br>

                    I was also the Head Author for the new Belgium Campus Student Representative Council Procedural
                    Document which takes effect 2019/2020.
