## Web-Assignment-01 and Progressive Web App Addition

# The Original Project
Hi everyone,  I've prepared an assignment for all of you to put your CSS, JS and HTML skills into use.
The due date for the assignment is next week Wednesday.

# PWA Project
As a practical exercise:
Choose an existing web application, either  Rick & Morty app or personal bio app and convert it to a PWA.
Once completed, please share the URL of the app so I can add it to my phone as a PWA, and your git hub repo so I can take a look at your code.
